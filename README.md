Question 2. You have a file named "Records.txt" containing student records. Each record contains a student
ID, name, department, and GPA, separated by commas.
Create a c++ program that manages student records using arrays. The program should be able to:
● Read the file "Records.txt" where each line contains a student ID, name, department, and GPA (e.g.,
"2021001, Alice, ComputerScience, 3.5") and each field is separated by comma.The first line of the
file contains no records.
● Store the student IDs, names, departments, and GPA’s using arrays.
● Allow user to view record of all the students
● Allow the user to add new student records, which should be appended to the file and your arrays will
be updated accordingly too.
● Allow the user to search for a student by ID and display the corresponding information of the
student.
● Allow the user to update the record of the student by searching with the ID, each student ID is
unique, before updating, your program should ask the user for the field which they want to update
(e:g Name,Department or CGPA or all),save the updated info into the file.
● The information in your files and arrays should be consistent.
● You have to make proper functions for View all records,search student,add new record and update
student info etc
